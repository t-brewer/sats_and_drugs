## Summary :

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA".  What you do in this project are good practices for all projects going forward, especially those after this bootcamp!


This project focuses on Exloratory Data Analysis (EDA) using two independent data sets : one involving SAT scores by state, and one involving drug use by age group.  EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions.  For each data set we explore relations/correlations between features, and see if we can hypothesize/infer any information from the exploration.  This project also demonstrates : 

- Use of Pandas DataFrames
- Descriptive Statistics
- Data Cleaning / Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Use of common Python plotting libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas' built in functions)

## Business Case

Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited _you_ via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!
